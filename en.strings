// The name of this file should be the associated locale code followed by ".strings",
// e.g. "en_US.strings"
//
// There is one .strings file per locale.
//
// Define your translated strings one line at a time like so:
// "My Key" = "My Translation";
// "My Other Key" = "My Other Translation";
//
// Keys can be any string; choose whatever scheme helps you stay organized.
//
// For example:
// "my.more.programmatic.key" = "A Translation";
//
// Then, set your LookML label and description parameters to the desired key values.
//
// To choose this file as the master key list and as the one to validate against,
// set its locale code ("en") as the default_locale in the manifest file.
